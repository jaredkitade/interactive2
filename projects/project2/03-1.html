		<p><h1>&ldquo;If All the Skies&rdquo;</h1></p>
		<p>Henry Van Dyke</p>
		<p>
			If all the skies were sunshine, 
			Our faces would be faint
			To feel once more upon them
			The cooling splash of rain.
		</p>

		<p>
			If all the world were music, 
			Our hearts would often long
			For one sweet strain of silence,
			To break the endless song.
		</p>
		<p>
			If life were always merry,
			Our souls would seek relief, 
			And rest from weary laughter 
			In the quiet arms of grief.
