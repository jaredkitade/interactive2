<p>&ldquo;If<br>All<br>the<br>Skies&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry<br>Van<br>Dyke</p>
<p>
	If<br>
	all the<br>
	skies were sunshine,<br>
	Our faces would be <br>
	faint To feel once more<br>
	upon them The cooling splash of<br>
	rain.
</p>

<p>
	If<br>
	all the<br>
	world were music,<br>
	Our hearts would often<br>
	long For one sweet strain<br>
	of silence, To break the endless<br>
	song.</p>

<p>
	If<br>
	life were<br>
	always merry, Our<br>
	souls would seek relief,<br>
	And rest from weary laughter<br>
	In the quiet arms of grief.</p>
