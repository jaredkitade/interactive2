<p><h6>&ldquo;If All the Skies&rdquo;</h6></p>
<p><h5>Henry Van Dyke</h5></p>
<p>
	<h4>If all the skies were sunshine,</h4>
	Our faces would be faint
	To feel once more upon them
	The cooling splash of rain.
</p>

<p>
	If all the world were music,
	Our hearts would often long
	For one sweet strain of silence,
	To break the endless song.</p>

<p>
	If life were always merry,
	Our souls would seek relief,
	And rest from weary laughter
	In the quiet arms of grief.</p>
