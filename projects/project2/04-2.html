<p>&ldquo;If All the Skies&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Van Dyke</p>
<p>
	If all the skies were sunshine, 
	Our faces would be faint
	To feel once more upon them
	The cooling splash of rain.
</p>

<p>
	If all the world were music, 
	Our hearts would often long
	For one sweet strain of silence,
	To break the endless song.</p>

<p>
	If life were always merry,
	Our souls would seek relief, 
	And rest from weary laughter 
	In the quiet arms of grief.</p>
