<p>&ldquo;If All the Skies&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Van Dyke</p>
<p>
	<h1>If all the skies were sunshine,</h1>
	<h2>Our faces would be faint</h2>
	<h3>To feel once more upon them</h3>
	<h4>The cooling splash of rain.</h4>
</p>
<br>
<p>
	<h5>If all the world were music,</h5>
	<h6>Our hearts would often long</h6>
	<h6>For one sweet strain of silence,</h6>
	<h5>To break the endless song.</h5>
</p>
<br>
<p>
	<h4>If life were always merry,</h4>
	<h3>Our souls would seek relief,</h3>
	<h2>And rest from weary laughter</h2>
	<h1>In the quiet arms of grief.</h1>
